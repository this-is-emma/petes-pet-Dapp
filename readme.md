# Pete's Pet Dapp

## Overview

This decentralized application (Dapp) serves as an adoption tracking system for Pete's Pet Shop. It utilizes Ethereum smart contracts to manage pet adoptions.

## Features

- Associates Ethereum addresses with pets available for adoption.
- Allows users to adopt pets by interacting with the smart contract through a user interface.

## Technology Stack

- Ethereum: Utilized for the underlying blockchain functionality.
- Truffle Suite: Used for development, testing, and deployment of smart contracts.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Developed the user interface for interacting with the Dapp.
- Solidity: Used for writing smart contracts.

## Development Process

The Dapp was developed following the steps outlined in the Truffle Suite tutorial. This includes:

1. Setting up the development environment.
2. Creating a Truffle project using a Truffle Box.
3. Writing the smart contract to manage pet adoptions.
4. Compiling and migrating the smart contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
5. Testing the smart contract functionality.
6. Developing a user interface to interact with the smart contract.
7. Interacting with the Dapp in a web browser.

## Usage

1. Upon accessing the Dapp, users can view the list of available pets for adoption.
2. Users can click on a pet to view its details and adoption status.
3. To adopt a pet, users need to connect their Ethereum wallet to the Dapp.
4. Once connected, users can initiate the adoption process by confirming the transaction through their wallet.
5. Upon successful adoption, the pet's status will be updated, and the user's Ethereum address will be associated with the adopted pet.
